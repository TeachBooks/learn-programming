# Programming book

An introduction programming-related stuff (not Python-specific)

Some notes as the book takes shape:

To keep URL's and ToC's readable, conventionally try to organize subdirectories of `./book/` using simple one-word names, and for chapters, sections, etc, try to align the name of the first page with the name of a sub-directory containing sub-pages. For example, the software installation chapters contain this pattern for:

- `./install/...`: `.book/install.md` and `./install/...`
- `./python/...`: `./install/python.md` and `./install/python/miniconda.md`
- `./vsc/...`: `./install/ide/vsc.md` and `./install/ide/vsc/extensions.md`
