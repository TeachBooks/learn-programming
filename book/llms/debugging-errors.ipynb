    "For minor errors, LLMs are very effective at providing quick fixes. In large projects, be careful to not provide too much context, as this can lead the LLM to focus on the wrong aspects of the code. Try being specific about the snippet you want it to analyze, rather than providing a lot of background information about the code's purpose or functionality. LLMs work best with concise, focused prompts that directly address the code snippet at hand.\n",
