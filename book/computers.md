**What is a computer?**

A quick look on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) provides a simple definition: _a computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation)._

This can take on a variety of meanings, and of course modern computers are everywhere around us, from smart watches and cell phones to the old desktop computer buried by old exams underneath Robert's desk. For our purposes in this book we will consider the following definition of computer

```{tip}
**Our Definition of Computer**: a machine that can be configured with software to execute programs to automatically carry out operations, in particular numerical analyses and visualization. The machine can be physically present, or a virtual machine (i.e., a cloud computer).
```

Terms:
- hardware
- software
- peripherals
- operating system
- application software
- virtual computer, cloud computer
- computing environments

Our goal is to write programs on our computer that can function on a wide variety of computers. In theory, this is simple: for example, we write code in Python and share it with others. Unfortunately the real world is more complex than that. There is huge variation amongst different computers, and it is not trivial to ensure that a piece of software produces the same results on all computers, let alone being able to run on various operating systems or intermediate application software.

Fortunately, there is a solution: _computing environments,_ described in another section of this book.
