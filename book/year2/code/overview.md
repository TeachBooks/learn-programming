text. Matlab also high level and multi-purpose like Python.

Things that will definitely go here:
- functions (a brief overview/highlight of features, then link to the object part of programs)
- complexity: where does it come from and why is it important (work backwards to know which concepts need to be included (e.g., bits and flops etc)); can find good reference rather than repeat chapters of numerical analysis textbook material

## Python language

There are some things included here, but we will need much more
