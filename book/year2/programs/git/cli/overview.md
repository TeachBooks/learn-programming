# git and GitLab

There are two methods for using git and GitLab in MUDE:
1. Using a graphical user interface (GUI), and
2. Using a command line interface (CLI) (**this Chapter**).

**At minimum for MUDE, you should be able to use the GUI tools.** The CLI tools are provided for those who are interested in learning how git works, and using a larger subset of the git toolkit; this will help you later on in your career if you are interested in getting involved with software projects and/or collaborating with a group of engineers working on programs and code.

The following sections will teach you how git works, as well as some particular workflows for working on distributed software projects with a team. We will start by teaching you how to use Git via command line interface then cover the interaction with GitLab. We strongly recommend that you complete the steps in this tutorial instead of simply reading over the document to familiarise yourself with how this tool works. In addition, try to type the commands instead of copy-pasting them, so that you could memorise them and be more efficient in your work later.

This chapter assumes you have already installed the git software, as described on the [module website](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/software/git_install/). For more information on expectations for MUDE students, review [this page on the website](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/draft/software/git/).

```{note}
While some of the concepts in the CLI chapter overlap with those in the GUI chapter, the order of topics is slightly different. In the GUI chapter we start with cloning a repository, whereas in the CLI chapter we begin by creating a local repository, then staging and committing changes before setting up the remote repository.

We recommend you complete the GUI chapter prior to starting this one: it does not take that long, and will give you a better understanding of the steps that are involved, as well as understanding how your colleagues who use the GUI are working.
