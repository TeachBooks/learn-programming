# git and GitLab

There are two methods for using git and GitLab in MUDE:
1. Using a graphical user interface (GUI) (**this Chapter**), and
2. Using a command line interface (CLI).

**At minimum for MUDE, you should be able to use the GUI tools.** The CLI chapter is provided as an option for those who are interested in learning how git works, and using a larger subset of the git toolkit; this will help you later on in your career if you are interested in getting involved with software projects and/or collaborating with a group of engineers working on programs and code.

This Chapter assumes you have already installed the git software, as described on the [module website](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/software/git_install/). For more information on expectations for MUDE students, review [this page on the website](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/draft/software/git/).

## GitHub GUI

GitHub (a competitor to Git**Lab**) provides a graphical user interface (GUI) software for free that makes using git and working with git repositories much easier. The sections within this chapter cover the following concepts:
1. **Cloning** a **remote repository** from your TU Delft GitLab
2. Making **commits** to the **local repository**
3. **Pushing** your commits back to the remote repository
4. Making commits to the remote repository using the online GitLab **IDE**
5. **Fetching** and **pulling** commits from the remote repository to your local repository
