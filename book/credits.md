The introduction, structure of the book and formatting of contents is done by the Editors, Robert Lanzafame and Tom van Woudenberg. Some chapters and pages have additional primary authors who are identified within the book either at the bottom of the first page in a chapter, or at the bottom of an individual page, as necessary. If an author is not listed on a particular page, it is Robert Lanzafame and Tom van Woudenberg.

You can refer to individual chapters or pages within this book as:

> `<Primary Author>` (2024) `<Title of Chapter or Page>`. In Lanzafame, R. and van Woudenberg, T. (Ed.), _Learn Programming for Engineers._ https://github.com/teachbooks/learn-programming

We anticipate that the content of this book will change significantly up to, and during, the 2025-2026 academic year. Therefore, we recommend using the source code directly with the citation above that refers to the GitHub repository and lists the date and name of the file. For example:

> `<Primary Author>` (2024) `<Title of Chapter or Page>`. In Lanzafame, R. and van Woudenberg, T. (Ed.), _Learn Programming for Engineers._ https://github.com/teachbooks/learn-programming (`./book/golden-rules/` chapter, accessed November, 2024).

%Although content will be added over time, chapter titles and URL's in this book are expected to remain relatively static. However, we make no guarantee, so if it is important for you to reference a specific location within the book, we recommend including the complete URL and date of access in your reference.

## How the book is made

This book is created using open source tools: it is a Jupyter Book that is written using Markdown, Jupyter notebooks and Python files to generate some figures. The files are stored on a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/learn-programming). The website can be viewed at https://teachbooks.github.io/learn-programming.
