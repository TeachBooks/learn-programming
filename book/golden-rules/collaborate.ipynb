    "Exchanging project archives and lack of version control are key problems in project collaborations. First, the changes made are not explicitly visible, unless you go over the entire project and compare new and old versions. Second, such exchanges of files is dangerous because one may confuse which is the final version. This is especially common with file names, for example, \"Document-1\", \"Document-2\", \"Document-2-Draft\", \"Document-2-DraftFinal\", \"Document-2-DraftFinal2\", et cetera. Third, it hardly allows working in parallel as merging work requires manual copy-pasting of each member's progress.\n",
