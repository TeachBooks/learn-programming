In addition, if you have many nested for loops or some very complex code, do not hesitate to put some in-line comments to describe what your code is doing. Overall, do not overdo it by commenting every single line, but rather try to elaborate in the way you structure your code and give names to your objects.

However, there is another benefit of adding a docstring: Python automatically knows to include the first line of a docsting in its built-in help functionality. Try it out here by adding a `?` after the function name (this is a handy trick that works in Jupyter notebooks)."
