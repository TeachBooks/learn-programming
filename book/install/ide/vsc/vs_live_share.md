Did you ever get frustrated by sharing code with your friends? How nice would it be to do it the Google-Docs style and work on the same document simultaneously! Maybe you know Deepnote, which does this in an online interface. But there's a better solution: [Visual Studio Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/)!

These steps are heavily based on the [Visual Studio IDE documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/nl-nl/visualstudio/liveshare/use/install-live-share-visual-studio-code) {cite:p}`microsoftWhatLive`.

1. [Download and install the Visual Studio Live Share Extension from Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) and reload Visual Studio Code. For Linux, see [this website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/reference/linux).

2. To collaborate, you'll need to sign in to Visual Studio Live Share so everyone knows who you are. This sign-in is a security measure and doesn't add you to marketing activities or other research activities. You can sign in by using a Microsoft personal account (for example, @outlook.com), your TU-Delft account (@student.tudelft.nl), or a GitHub account.

3. Select **Live Share** on the status bar or select **Ctrl+Shift+P** or **Cmd+Shift+P** and then select **Live Share: Sign In**.

4. A prompt to sign in displays. When you select your sign-in preference, a browser opens so you can complete the sign-in process. Close the browser when you're done. If Visual Studio Code isn't picking up your sign-in after you complete the sign-in process in the browser, see [this website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/troubleshooting#sign-in).
