# VS Code Extensions

This page gives an overview of useful extensions in VS Code, with short tips on how to install them or what they could be used for. It is organized by various user types.

To install an extension, select the "Extensions" box on the left side of the application (the symbol is four boxes), then search for and install the following (entering the ID in the search box turns up the right result).

As VS Code and its extensions are actively developed by a large international community, we don't include exhaustive instructions and troubleshooting help in this book; instead, you should search for up-to-date solutions on the internet. For example, the [Extension Marketplace page from VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace) is already quite thorough.

## First Time User

New to VS Code? New to programming in general? If you are using Python, we recommend starting with the following extensions:

- Python (Extension ID: `ms-python.python`)
- Jupyter (Extension ID: `ms-toolsai.jupyter`)

```{tip}
Note that if you are using the Jupyter extension it is good to include `ipykernel` in your Python environments (but VS Code will add this automatically for you if you don't - isn't VS Code great?!).
```

## Git

For general use with Git**Hub** use the following:

- GitHub Pull Requests (Extension ID: `GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github`)
