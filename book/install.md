# Software Installation

This is a generic overview of all the "stuff" we may want to install. The pages here focus purely on the installation steps. For use and purpose of the software, see other pages.

```{note}
Even though `conda` is an environment manager that handles _much_ more than the Python language, it is organized under the Python chapter, as Python is by far the most common reason students install `conda` for the first time, when these instructions are needed.
