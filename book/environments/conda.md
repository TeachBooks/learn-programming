# Conda

This is about the tool `conda`

Work in progress.




## Create 

Create an environment by executing the following command in Anaconda Prompt with your own `environment name` and Python version number:

`conda create -c conda-forge -n <environment name> python=3.12`

Conda-forge is specified as a channel for downloading

Conda will determine the installation files needed and ask if you want to proceed (type `y` and hit `enter`). Once complete there will be a final message `Executing transaction: done` and instructions for how to activate and deactivate the environment, for example: `conda activate mude-base`.
