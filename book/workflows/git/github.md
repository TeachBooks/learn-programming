# Git on GitHub

This workflow will focus on using Source Control on GitHub: making commits to the remote repository using the online GitHub IDE

```{note}
The examples in this page will be illustrated using an arbitrary public repository set up by a MUDE TA on GitHub called [sandbox-public](https://github.com/monadevos/sandbox-public/) and a fork called [similarly](https://github.com/Tom-van-Woudenberg/sandbox-public). You can follow along by [creating your own repository in your GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).

If you create your own repository, keep the box checked to initialize with a `README.md` file, which will look identical to that in the examples in the following pages.
