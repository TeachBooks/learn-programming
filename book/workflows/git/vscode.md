# Git in VS code

This workflow will focus on using Source Control in VS Code in combination with GitHub:
1. Cloning a remote repository from your TU Delft GitHub
2. Making commits to the local repository and Pushing your commits back to the remote repository
3. Fetching and pulling commits from the remote repository to your local repository


```{note}
The examples in this page will be illustrated using an arbitrary public repository set up by a MUDE TA on GitHub called [sandbox-public](https://github.com/monadevos/sandbox-public/). You can follow along by [creating your own repository in your GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).

If you create your own repository, keep the box checked to initialize with a `README.md` file, which will look identical to that in the examples in the following pages.
