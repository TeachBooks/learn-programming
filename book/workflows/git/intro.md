# Workflow git

There are two methods for using git and GitLab in MUDE:
1. Using the Source Control integrated in VS Code
2. Using a command line interface (CLI).

**At minimum for MUDE, you should be able to use the Source Control in VS Code.** The CLI chapter is provided as an option for those who are interested in learning how git works, and using a larger subset of the git toolkit; this will help you later on in your career if you are interested in getting involved with software projects and/or collaborating with a group of engineers working on programs and code.

This Chapter assumes you have already installed the git software, as described [here] ().

The sections within this chapter cover the following concepts:
1. **Cloning** a **remote repository** from your TU Delft GitLab
2. Making **commits** to the **local repository**
3. **Pushing** your commits back to the remote repository
4. Making commits to the remote repository using the online GitLab **IDE**
5. **Fetching** and **pulling** commits from the remote repository to your local repository
